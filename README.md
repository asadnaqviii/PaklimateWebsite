# Paklimate Web Application using DSA in Python
For the 3rd Semester Project of course "Data Structures and Algorithms", we had to implement the fundamental DSA concepts using Python so we decided to create a full stack web application using Anvil Framework. 
## Goal 
Our goal was to create awareness related to climate issues in Pakistan hence the name "Paklimate" while using data structures like linked list and algorithms like bubble sort in the backend.
## Anvil Framework 
Anvil is a full-stack web app framework that uses only Python, both on the client-side and the server-side. This simplifies web app development by allowing you to use Python in the front-end, back-end, and even for database interactions. Anvil also offers a drag-and-drop designer for UI elements, making it accessible to developers of varying skill levels.
